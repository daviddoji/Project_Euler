    The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

    The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
    (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025

    Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten
    natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

    Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one
    hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
